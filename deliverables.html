<p>The forum (robben-island-forum.org.za) will allow users to participate in discussions about the Island’s collections and submit related artifacts. The “Home” page will describe the project, the “Collections” page will feature digitized items from the RIM collection for users to discuss, the “Community” page will include forum posts tagged to only be accessible to community members, and the “Forum” page will include posts approved for public access by contributors. The forum will include a tagging system allowing users to flag sensitive items that will be only visible to community members. The public will be able to access anything posted to the general forum page. The collections page will feature digitized artifacts from the RIM Historical Collection currently housed in UWC-Robben Island Mayibuye Archive that had to be removed from the Island for preservation. Community members will be able to comment and contextualize these items via the forum.</p>
