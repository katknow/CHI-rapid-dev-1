<h1>Partners</h1>

<p>Our partners are the Robben Island Museum, the University of Cape Town, the University of Western Cape Mayibuye Archives, and the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture. The Robben Island Museum has existing digital heritage projects, and we will be partnering with them to incorporate their Virtual Tour Map and Interactive Timeline as elements and resources on our website. The University of Cape Town and University of Western Cape are home to portions of the Robben Island Collections, both object collections and portions of the archives, so  they will be a partner on digitization efforts. We want to emphasize that the strength of this project comes from the community partnerships that will be created and cultivated through the community-engaged and participatory focus. While the above partners provide crucial resources and institutional support, the aim of this project is to highlight individual and community stakeholders and their commitment to the preservation of cultural heritage at Robben Island.</p>

<h1>Audience</h1>

<p>Our audience will primarily be individuals with a personal or professional stake in Robben Island and the holdings of the Robben Island Museum. While the Museum itself focuses largely on the tourism industry on the Island, our forum project prioritizes community and individually lead conversations and engagement. This engaged, participatory, and collaborative project therefore focuses on the communities represented on the RIM interactive map as well as associated heritage institutions.</p>
