<h1>
  Functionality
</h1>
<p>The website will be built using bootstrap and will feature forum, tagging, and file upload functionalities. Users will be able to create an account that will allow them to post to the forum, whether they just want to contribute written text or upload an accompanying file (ideally, an image or audio recording). The tagging system will determine who is able to access which discussions and files, but will also provide a way to link these items with the relevant locations or events on the Museum’s map and timeline. Behind the scenes, our partners at the UWC-Robben Island Mayibuye Archive will be digitizing materials using both 3D and flatbed scanners for upload to the collections page. The project will be housed on the same servers that host the Robben Island Museum main page. The digitized archival materials may be housed on University of Western Cape servers as part of their existing workflows.</p>

<h1>
  Data, Information, & Content
</h1>
<p>The majority of the site’s content will be the user provided materials (both forum posts and file uploads) and the digitized archival materials. The forum and uploads will be housed with the rest of the RIM web data, and copies of the digital artifacts created during the project period will be housed in the UWC-Robben Island Mayibuye Archive’s existing collection management system. Users are owners of their created materials and can request the removal of their content at any time. Content will be sorted by tags and linked to the appropriate locations or events that are displayed on RIM website’s map and timeline pages.</p>
