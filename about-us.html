                            <p class="text-muted mb-0">Eric Kesse is a Charlotte W. Newcombe Fellow and final-year doctoral candidate in African History at Michigan State. He studies the African environment with particular attention to Africa’s water systems and bodies of water. His work explores how African groups developed complex relationships with bodies of water over time and how those relationships shaped the history of the continent. Eric is excited to be part of this year's CHI Fellowship program, which allows him to work closely with colleague fellows to apply computational and digital approaches to understanding and recreating history.</p>
